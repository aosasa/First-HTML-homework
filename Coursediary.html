        <p style="color: purple;">This semester I am taking a course in <b>front-end programming</b>. I decided to study it as I feel that I am lacking the knowledge about coding. I see the course a a first step in my <del>luckally</del> sofware ingeneering career :) </p>

    <nav><h3><em>My motivation</em></h3></nav>
    <p>Even though, I have always had a severe interest in IT. Moreover, I liked Informatics (and had high grades), but I always needed moral support to continue my studies in that field. I came from a country where women in tech are stigmatised. This course is my opportunity to start my dream journey and gain programming skills.</p>
<br><nav><h2>First lesson</h2></nav>
<p class="first-lesson">In the first lesson, we learned the basics of HTML: making simple lines, headings, and text formatting. Also, there was a GitHub tutorial. As I know a bit more then it was in the tutorial, I decided to add a button to my Github account. I enjoyed it! </p>
